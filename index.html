        <p>Thank you for visiting my personal portfolio webpage, which I have designed myself!</p>
        <p>
        I am currently a student at the George Washington University Coding Bootcamp. I am looking to 
        make a career change and hopefully break into the technology sector as a web developer with 
        the skills that I am learning in this program. </p>
        <p>
        I have a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Government & Political Science from the University of North Carolina - Charlotte.
        While at Charlotte, I was a student-athlete participating in football for 3 years including the school's inaugural season in 2013.
        I also have a passion for Aviaton. I currently have 50 flight hours logged in the Cessna 172 aircraft, as part of Dulles Aviation Flight School's private pilot license program.
        </p>
